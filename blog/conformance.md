title: Conformance Tests
---

This article details three github repositories for testing our parser against
JavaScript and TypeScript grammar.

<!--truncate-->

## Test262

JavaScript has the [`ECMAScript Test Suite`](HTTPS://github.com/tc39/test262)
called Test262. The goal of Test262 is to provide test material that covers
every observable behavior specified in the specification.

For testing conformance, please checkout its
[`parse phase tests`](HTTPS://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/INTERPRETING.md#negative).

## Babel

When new language features are added to JavaScript, it is required to have them
get parsed by Babel. So Babel has another set of
[`parser tests`](HTTPS://github.com/babel/babel/tree/main/packages/babel-parser/test).

## TypeScript

The TypeScript conformance tests can be found
[`here`](HTTPS://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tree/main/tests/cases/conformance).

## Test Runner

Rome has implemented a test runner for the above test suites, they can be found
[`here`](HTTPS://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/xtask/coverage).
